        <p>Javascript is a programming language. It is a dynamicaaly typed stored value. We use it to give instructions to computer.</p>

    <h2>Notes</h3>
    <h3>Topic : Synchronous in Javascript</h3>
    <p><b>Synchronous - </b>  It means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in a program. Each instructions waits for the previois instructions to complete the instructions.</p>
    <p><b>Asynchronous - </b> Due to synchronous programming sometimes important instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in UI.</p>
    <p>Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.</p>

    <p><b>Callback - </b>  A Callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.</p>
    <p><b>Callback Hell - </b> Nested Callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. (pyramid of doom). <br/>
        This style of programming becomes difficult to understand and manage.
    </p>

    <p><b>PROMISE -</b>  Promise is for eventual completion of task. It is an object in JS. <br>
        It is a solution to callback hell.
    </p>
    <p><b>Syntax - </b> let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {.............})</p>
    <p>Resolve and Reject are the two handlers provided by JS.</p>
